    "bar charts for categorical data, and then variances in approval rates of the categorical.\n",
    "</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The only box plots that showed meaningful insight were for Duration_in_month and Credit_amount.  As with the histograms, these two features showed that most people applied for credit that was short term and low amount. This supports a common sense idea that a bank would prefer to give credit under those conditions as it is \n",
    "more likely the debtor could repay the loan.  The rest of the features didn't show much in the perspective of box plots.  Additional features that we ran histograms on fit with common sense ideas to approve credit.  A high income to debt ratio, longer residency, a low number of other credits at the bank, all support ability to repay.  The age of applicants mostly falls in the range of 25 to 40 years old.  This also makes sense that people who are younger are likely earning less and could use credit to make purchases.  As someone gets older, they are likely earning more and have less of a need for credit.   \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "The categorical features also demonstrated reasonable expectations describing an applicant.  For example, most applicants had little or no money in checking or savings. They had no one to guarantee or cosigner on a loan.  These would be the type of people that would want to obtain credit as they don't have the cash to make the purchase they want to otherwise.  At the same time, the majority of applicants have other property or assets to support against the loan.  The fact that the majority of applicants do have this is because that other people have the belief they wouldn't get approved so never applied.  Some other takeaways from the bar charts are that good credit history, longer employment, few outstanding debts have high approval and characteristics of the applicants.  Another notable feature is that most applicants fall in the skilled employee/official category.  Again, perhaps people not in this category don't expect a loan to be approved and therefore don't apply. Some other insights from the categorical data is that most applicants appear to be purchasing personal property (cars, furniture, TVs).  The majority of applicants are also foreign.  That would be interesting to understand better why this is.  It is also odd that there are three categories for male and only one for female. \n",
    "</p>\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "We looked at approval rates and compared to the mean of the categories to gather more insights.  Interestingly, we saw the highest approval rate with applicants who had no checking account in the Current_balance feature (second was applicants with more than 200 DM, which makes sense).  In terms of credit history, the highest approved where applicants with credits at other banks.  This doesn't make complete sense as someone would arguably be more likely to default if they had payment obligations elsewhere.  The majority of approvals went to applicants looking to purchase used cars and TVs.  This seems logical in that those are likely low risk (short duration and amount).  Over half of the applicants were single males and that group and married males were much more likely to get approved.  This category is odd in that there are three categories for males and only one for females.  In addition, only about a quarter of applicants are female.  It seems that there is a cultural phenomenon in Germany that females don't get loans/aren't approved for loans or this data was somehow poorly sampled and a more realistic percentage of female applicants was missed.  The additional features fit with common sense risk factors.  No property and existing credit increased denials. Lastly, foreign workers had a significantly lower chance of approval relative to non-foreign workers.  At the same time, nearly all applicants were foreign.  This makes an interesting question as to why non-foreigners don't apply for credit. \n",
